I do not know much about Pokemon except that they grow and advance with certain foods and by winning challenges.
Looking at the code for Pidgey, it is long.  There are multiple level-groups with new moves learned and sizes.  All the pokemon will have this so I will get a couple specifics.
Pidgey's first ability is "keen eye".  It is not hidden so is available at level 1 for it.
Version-group details at level 0 is an egg which would be what it is before it is Pidgey.

second pokemon: Charmandar
