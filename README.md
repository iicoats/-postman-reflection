I do not know much about Pokemon except that they grow and advance with certain foods and by winning challenges.
Looking at the code for Pidgey, it is long.  There are multiple level-![image](https://github.com/iicoats/-postman-reflection/assets/145803389/edfa52b9-0fe5-4e40-b5c0-66bccff47696)
 with new moves learned and sizes.  All the pokemon will have this so I will get a couple specifics.
Pidgey's first ability is "keen eye".  It is not hidden so is available at level 1 for it.
Version-group details at level 0 is an egg which would be what it is before it is Pidgey.
Pidgey is the first version of this pokemon

second pokemon: Charmandar

Charmandar learns "scratch" at level 1.
Charmandar is the first level, the second is Charmeleon.

third pokemon: Blastois

Blastois is the third level for Squirtel.  Rain-dish is a hidden ability.
